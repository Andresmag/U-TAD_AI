# Master's Degree in Video game programming at U-Tad
## Artificial Intelligence

Practices for the subject Artificial Intelligence

* Practice 1: Rotating triangles. Basic primitives.
* Practice 2: The World and its entities. Texture loading.
* Practice 3: Mesh loading.
* Practice 4: Illumination.

Every practice is an improvement from the last one so a lot of the code is reused.
But you should look at it closely because sometimes although it's really similar it has a little change.

### Instructions to compile and run the code
* Firstly, you need to download this [MOAI SDK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GqRd5cHGrn9zGL_efL5d0hvEm3hlHTIG/view?usp=sharing). It's a reduction from the real one which you can find at its [repository](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/tree/develop/src/lua-headers).
* Folder structure must be:
  * data
  * lib
  * project
  * src
