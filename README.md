# Master's Degree in Video game programming at U-Tad
## Artificial Intelligence

Practices for the subject Artificial Intelligence.

* Practice 1: Steering behavior: basic movement.
* Practice 2: Steering behavior: advanced movement.
* Practice 3: Pathfinding A*.
* Practice 4: Navmesh creation.
* Practice 5: Pathfinding in navmesh.
* Practice 6: State Machines.
* Practice 7: Behavior Trees.


Every practice is an improvement from the last one so a lot of the code is reused.
But you should look at it closely because sometimes although it's really similar it has a little change.

### Instructions to compile and run the code
* Firstly, you need to download this [MOAI SDK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GqRd5cHGrn9zGL_efL5d0hvEm3hlHTIG/view?usp=sharing). It's a reduction from the real one which you can find at its [repository](https://github.com/moai/moai-dev/tree/develop/src/lua-headers).
* MOAI folder must be at the same level in the path that the practice folder.
* Inside practice folder must be the **host folder** and **stdafx.h/.cpp**.
* Code must be compiled for **x86**.
